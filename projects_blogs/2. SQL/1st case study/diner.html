            <h3 class="blog-subheading">Introduction:</h3>
            <p>Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.</p>
            <p>Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="text-justify">
            <h3 class="blog-subheading">Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.</p>
            <p>He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.</p>
            <p>Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!</p>
            <h4>Danny has shared with me 3 key datasets for this case study:</h4>

                <summary>Click to view</summary>
                <p><h5>Customer segmentation:</h5> Knowing the total spending of each customer allows the restaurant to segment its customer base based on their spending habits. This information can help identify high-value customers who contribute significantly to the restaurant's revenue. The restaurant can then tailor specific marketing campaigns or loyalty programs to retain and attract such customers.</p>
                <p><h5>Menu optimization:</h5> By analyzing the spending patterns of customers, the restaurant can gain insights into which menu items are most popular and generate higher revenue. This information can be used to optimize the menu, ensuring that the most profitable and in-demand dishes are prioritized while considering the profitability of individual items.</p>
                <p><h5>Upselling and cross-selling opportunities:</h5> Understanding the total spending of each customer enables the restaurant staff to identify opportunities for upselling and cross-selling.</p> 
                        <p>For example, if a customer consistently spends a certain amount on their visits, the staff can recommend additional menu items or suggest higher-priced options to increase the average transaction value.</p>
                <p><h5>Personalized marketing and promotions:</h5> By analyzing individual customer spending, the restaurant can create personalized marketing campaigns and promotions.</p> 
                        <p>For example, customers who spend more can be offered exclusive discounts or rewards to encourage repeat visits. On the other hand, customers who spend less can be targeted with promotions to entice them to spend more.</p>
                <p><h5>Customer satisfaction and loyalty:</h5> The total spending of each customer can be an indicator of their satisfaction level with the restaurant's offerings. By monitoring and analyzing this data, the restaurant can identify customers who may be at risk of churning or decreasing their spending. Proactive measures can then be taken to address any issues and improve customer satisfaction, thereby fostering loyalty and retaining valuable customers.</p>

This segmentation helps identify loyal customers who visit frequently and can be targeted with special offers or loyalty programs to enhance their satisfaction and encourage repeat visits.</p>
                <p><h5>Resource allocation:</h5> Knowing the number of visits per customer helps with resource allocation and staffing decisions. It allows the business to anticipate busy periods and allocate staff accordingly to provide excellent service during peak times when frequent customers are likely to visit.</p>
                <p><h5>Customer retention: </h5> Monitoring the visit frequency helps in identifying customers who may be at risk of churning or decreasing their visits.

                <p><h5>Marketing strategies: </h5> The visit frequency data can guide marketing strategies and promotional campaigns. Customers who visit less frequently can be targeted with personalized offers or incentives to encourage them to visit more often. In contrast, frequent customers can be rewarded for their loyalty, driving customer satisfaction and fostering a positive brand image.</p> 
                <p><h5>Menu and service optimization:</h5> By analyzing visit frequency, the business can gain insights into customer preferences and adjust the menu or service offerings accordingly. It allows for menu optimization, highlighting popular dishes and removing less popular ones to better cater to customer preferences and increase overall satisfaction.</p>

                <summary>Click to view</summary>
                <p><h5>Easy data access:</h5>The data tables provide a consolidated view of the relevant information, making it easier and quicker for Danny and his team to access the insights they need. Instead of writing complex SQL queries every time, they can directly refer to the pre-built tables.</p>
                <p><h5>Streamlined analysis:</h5>By having the necessary data already organized in tables, Danny and his team can perform analysis and derive insights more efficiently. They can apply filters, sorting, grouping, and other operations directly on the tables, saving time and effort.</p>
                <p><h5>Quick decision-making: </h5>The availability of pre-built data tables allows for faster decision-making. Danny and his team can access the required information promptly, enabling them to make informed decisions and take actions promptly without the need for extensive SQL queries or data manipulations.</p>
                <p><h5>Improved productivity:</h5>With pre-built data tables, Danny and his team can focus on analyzing the data and extracting insights rather than spending time writing complex SQL queries or joining tables. This improves overall productivity and efficiency in generating insights and executing data-driven tasks.</p>
                <p><h5>Reproducibility and consistency:</h5>The data tables ensure consistency in the information provided, as they are pre-built and based on reliable data sources. This allows for reproducibility of analysis, making it easier to track and compare insights over time.</p>

            <h3 class="blog-subheading">Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, this case study focused on analyzing customer patterns and preferences at Danny's Diner, a Japanese food restaurant. The goal was to enhance the customer experience and loyalty program by utilizing data-driven insights.</p>
            <p>The study began with an introduction to Danny's Diner and its need for assistance in leveraging the captured data to run the business effectively. The problem statement emphasized Danny's desire to understand customer visiting patterns, expenditure, and favorite menu items to personalize the dining experience and strengthen customer loyalty.</p>
            <p>Three key datasets were provided: sales, menu, and members. The sales table captured customer-level purchases with order dates and corresponding product IDs. The menu table mapped product IDs to product names and prices. The members table recorded customer IDs and join dates for the loyalty program.</p>
            <p>The questions covered various aspects, such as total customer expenditure, number of days visited, first and most popular menu items, and points earned through the loyalty program.</p>
            <p>By answering these questions, Danny's Diner can gain valuable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and loyalty, enabling them to make informed decisions about enhancing the customer experience and expanding the loyalty program.</p>
            <p>In summary, through data analysis and SQL queries, Danny's Diner can unlock the potential of their captured data to provide a better dining experience, strengthen customer relationships, and drive business growth.</p>
