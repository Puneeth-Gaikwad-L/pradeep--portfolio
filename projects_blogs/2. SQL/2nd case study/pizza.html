            <h3 class="blog-subheading">Introduction:</h3>
            <p>Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza is consumed daily worldwide??? (Well according to Wikipedia anyway…)</p>
            <p>Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”</p>
            <p>Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!</p>
            <p>Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="text-justify">
            <h3 class="blog-subheading">Available Data</h3>
            <p>Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business’ growth.</p>
            <p>He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.</p>

            <h4>Danny has shared with me 6 key datasets for this case study:</h4>
            <ul>

            <h5>Table 2: customer_orders</h5>
            <p>ustomer pizza orders are captured in the customer_orders table with 1 row for each individual pizza that is part of the order.</p>
            <p>The pizza_id relates to the type of pizza which was ordered whilst the exclusions are the ingredient_id values which should be removed from the pizza and the extras are the ingredient_id values which need to be added to the pizza.</p>
            <p>Note that customers can order multiple pizzas in a single order with varying exclusions and extras values even if the pizza is the same type!</p>
            <p>The exclusions and extras columns will need to be cleaned up before using them in your queries.</p>

                <p><h5>Performance Evaluation:</h5>The success percentage allows the business to evaluate each runner's performance. Runners with higher success percentages are likely to be more reliable and efficient in delivering orders.

                <p><h5>Quality Control:</h5>By tracking the success percentage over time, the business can monitor the consistency of each runner's performance. If a runner's success percentage drops significantly, it may indicate an issue that needs to be addressed, such as delayed deliveries, damaged goods, or customer complaints. Timely identification of such issues allows the business to take corrective measures, such as providing additional training or investigating potential problems.</p>
                <p><h5>Customer Satisfaction:</h5>Successful deliveries contribute to customer satisfaction. By analyzing the success percentages, the business can identify areas where improvements are needed to enhance customer experience. For example, if a runner consistently has a low success percentage, it might be necessary to review their route planning, delivery instructions, or communication with customers to minimize delivery failures and increase customer satisfaction.</p> 
                <p><h5>Resource Allocation:</h5>Understanding the success percentages of individual runners helps with resource allocation and workload distribution. The business can assign more deliveries to runners with higher success percentages, knowing they are likely to handle the orders effectively. On the other hand, runners with lower success percentages might require additional support or training to improve their performance.</p> 
                <p><h5>Business Growth:</h5>Monitoring and improving the success percentages of runners can contribute to the overall growth of the business. Reliable and successful deliveries enhance the business's reputation, leading to increased customer trust and loyalty. Satisfied customers are more likely to recommend the service to others, resulting in new customers and business expansion.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, the data analysis of Pizza Runner's database has provided valuable insights into the operations and customer experience of the pizza delivery service. By examining various pizza metrics, we gained a deeper understanding of the ordering patterns and preferences of customers. We discovered the total number of pizzas ordered, the unique customer orders, and the popularity of different pizza types among customers. Additionally, we explored the frequency of changes made to pizzas, such as exclusions and extras, and identified the pizzas that had both exclusions and extras.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we delved into the runner and customer experience aspects of Pizza Runner. We analyzed the number of runners signing up over specific periods, examined the average time taken by runners to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ for order pickup, and explored the relationship between the number of pizzas and the time required to prepare an order. Additionally, we investigated the average distance traveled by customers and identified the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times.</p>
            <p>The analysis also allowed us to evaluate runner performance. We calculated the average speed for each runner and determined the successful delivery percentage for each runner. These insights can assist Pizza Runner in optimizing their operations, improving delivery efficiency, and enhancing the overall customer experience.</p>
            <p>By leveraging the power of data analysis, Pizza Runner can make data-driven decisions to streamline their processes, enhance delivery services, and tailor their offerings to better suit customer preferences. This holistic approach will enable Pizza Runner to establish a strong foothold in the competitive pizza delivery market and provide a seamless and delightful experience to their customers.</p>
            <p>As Pizza Runner continues to grow and expand its operations, regular data analysis and optimization will be key to maintaining customer satisfaction, maximizing efficiency, and driving business success.</p>
